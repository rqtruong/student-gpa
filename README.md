This is a GPA calculator created for a coding challenge.
It takes student data from an initial .json file and displays student names, grades, and calculated GPA in a table.
Students can be added or removed from the table.
The students with highest and lowest GPAs are highlighted in green and red, respectively. This conditional highlighting updates dynamically with any changes to the table.
